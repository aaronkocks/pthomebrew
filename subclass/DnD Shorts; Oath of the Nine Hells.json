				"Forged in fire and desperation, far from the golden skies and stifling tranquility of the higher planes, warriors battle endlessly for the fate of all realms. Devils, demons, and other unimaginable creatures run rampant across the underworlds, each faction a world-devouring force, like a great colossal hydra, ready to conquer all if not for the interference of each other. In this eternal battleground, some warriors find meaning. Those who take the Oath of the Nine Hells pledge themselves to the under-world, wielding the strength of devils. Some do this for selfish reasons, eager to harness the fiery power of hell, while others see it as the lesser of two evils, fighting fire with hellfire. In all cases, Oath of the Nine Hells Paladins are ferocious, brave, and blessed with devilish ambition and cunning. They despise demons, recognising the threat they pose to the entire multiverse, and channel infernal magic to utterly incinerate any foe who stands in their way.",
